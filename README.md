Loan Calculator Code Description:

LoanSimulator should contain one main method that drive the entire simulation. There should be very little branching code in main. It should just call methods
It should contain UserInput method.  This method should be responsible for gathering and verifying the user's inputs. If the user enters an invalid value, they should be prompted to re-enter the information until they enter a valid value. The user should be prompted for the following information:
Loan amount: The amount should not be less than 0
Annual Interest Rate : The value should be an Integer instead of double
Loan Period
A runSimulation method. This method is responsible for calculating monthlypayment and totalPayment. The annual interest rate should be randomized using the value prompted. The randomized value should not be Zero.
At last you have printResult method. It should display all the original values entered. Also the values for monthlypayment and totalpayment. Make sure to use DecimalFormat to format monthlypayment and totalpayment.


Lottery Java Code Description:

Getting a single-occupancy room in a dormitory is very tough because of the high demand. There is one especially large and comfortable single occupancy room in your dorm that everybody covets. The housing office runs a lottery at the beginning of a quarter. Students must submit their entries before the lottery. The result of the lottery will consist of three cards. The numbers on the cards range from 10 to 15 and the color of the card can be red, green, or black. 

Write a program to create winning combination of lottery card. Use two classes  LotteryCard and RoomWinner. RoomWinner will be the driver class.

Reversing an Array:

Write a program that prompts the user for an integer, then asks the user to enter that many values. Store these values in an array and print the array. Then reverse the array elements so that the first element becomes the last element, the second element becomes the second to last element, and so on, with the old last element now first. Do not just reverse the order in which they are printed; actually, change the way they are stored in the array. Do not create a second array; just rearrange the elements within the array you have. (Hint: Swap elements that need to change places.) When the elements have been reversed, print the array again. 

After printing the array in reverse order. Create another array that holds the array sort in ascending order.
